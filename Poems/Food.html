He’s in a small room,
seems to be hiding,
takes out three bombs the size of steamed rice balls,
lights them,
shoves them under a hole.

The gardening teacher once told us,
put flowers where there are cracks,
put grass where there are holes,
big grass—
Cantonese bok choy.

On the air vent,
sits a yellow box,
looks like a delivery order,
thin white smoke,
drifts from the explosives at the hole,
into that delivery box.

A winter afternoon, four o’clock,
passing through the stairs beside the pomelo trees,
at the school gate someone sells bento,
limited time only,
fifteen minutes.

I saw it—
there are really food,
steaming rice,
vegetables,
tofu.

I asked the person standing there,
“Are you selling them?”
He said he’s just a teacher.

I wanted to steal a lunch box.
Then thought, maybe not.

Looked at the price again—
fifteen yuan to be full,
rice cakes twenty-eight for twenty-eight,
I wanted those too.

Behind the door on the left was my math teacher,
I ran there,
kept closing the door in front of her,
then waited for it to open again.
I saw her daughter walking through the school gate,
maybe she was watching her daughter.

I turned to the glass on the right,
printed on it was a rap lyric,
the lyric was bad,
I don't know what to say.
