  <pre>
I never thought I'd return to old home,
but here I am.
A dim night.
In the bedroom corner, a few boxes of snacks,
a tin of biscuits writes 8646.
Beneath the box, another one—
perhaps for some holiday,
maybe Christmas.

My hair is thick.
The friends in the room
say we should all go out and make love,
but I’m in the shower,
my hair tangled.

Outside the window,
a gray car pulls away slowly.
I don’t know whose it is.

I think about sending a text,
asking someone out,
but don’t know whom to send.

A man walks in, holding a gun.
I go out the door.
Between the cars and the security booth,
I hesitate,
then choose the booth,
to tell them about the man with the gun.

There are three guards.
One of them makes the closed door ajar,
as if that would make the conversation safer.

The man suddenly leans in through the door,
a double-barreled gun
aimed at me—
one shot,
two shots.

I think for a moment.
Perhaps I misread him.
He killed only for the sake of killing.
