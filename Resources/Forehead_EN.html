INDICATION: 
This is a 24 y.o. patient with gender dysphoria who is here for Type 3 Forehead Reconstruction surgery.  The risks, benefits, complications, and alternatives including but not limited to bleeding, infection, anesthesia, injury to surrounding structures such as the brain and the globe, and reoperation were discussed with the patient and written consent was obtained.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: 
The patient was successfully placed under general anesthesia and an atraumatic endotracheal intubation was performed. The patient was turned 180 degrees and placed in a slight reverse Trendelenberg position. The patient was prepped and draped in the usual standard manner.
 
A 15 blade was used to incise the skin and galea.  The anterior scalp was elevated in the subperiosteal plane.  Laterally, the dissection proceeded immediately over the deep temporal fascia taking care to stay well below the frontal branch of the facial nerve.  The orbits were then dissected out superiorly.  Supraorbital foramina were found and thus a baby osteotome was used to osteotomize the spicules.  Laterally the orbits were dissected down to the zygomaticofrontal suture. Using the virtually planned, 3D printed frontal sinus guide, the anterior table of the frontal sinus was marked out.  A Maestro was used to osteotomize the anterior table of the frontal sinus down to the nasofrontal junction.  The septum of the frontal sinus was marked out and osteotomized with a baby osteotome. After removal of the anterior table, the bone was contoured on the back table to remove the areas of protrusion.  Both nasofrontal ducts were well visualized, irrigated with Duobiotic solution, and found to be patent.
 
Next, the virtually planned, 3D printed, custom forehead reshaping guide was placed on the frontal bone.  A 2.7 mm drill was used to drill into the frontal bone at varying depths based on the guide.  A pineapple burr was then used to burr down the entire forehead, superior orbital rims, and lateral orbital rims.  The radix was also burred down to ensure a smooth transition from radix to the anterior table of the frontal sinus.  The planned setback of the anterior table was 4.5 mm. 
 
A split cranial bone graft measuring 4 x 3 cm on the parietal skull was harvested and used to reconstruct the anterior table of the frontal sinus using a stubby osteotome.  The bone graft was then placed in the gaps between the anterior table and the native calvarium.  Bone dust collected during burring was then packed on top of the reconstruction to blunt the transitions between the bones of the forehead and then parietal cranial bone graft donor site.
 
To perform a bilateral brow lift, the brow was marked at the level of the lateral limbus. The anterior skin flap was tailor-tacked to the posterior scalp until a symmetric lift of the brows was accomplished. The excess posterior scalp was then excised with a 15 blade. The galea was then closed with a 3-0 Vicryl sutures.  The skin was approximated with 4-0 Monocryl sutures.

The incision was dressed with Bactroban, Xeroform, Kerlix, and a Flexinet dressing. All counts were correct x2 and the patient was awakened from anesthesia without incident.
 
Complexity Statement:
This was a complex case secondary to significant preoperative planning necessary for the operation, the multiple anatomical areas involved in the procedure, the multiple steps required for setting back the frontal bone and recontouring the supraorbital rim and lateral orbital rim, the harvesting of the split cranial bone grafts to ensure bony union requiring 2.5 hours to complete the case.

<strong>The following is my account:</strong>
The surgery took place at 7:30 a.m. on February 3 at UCLA Medical Center, performed by Dr. Justin Lee.
Preparing for this operation wasn’t easy. I had to request medical leave, coordinate work, complete pre-operative tests — a cardiac stress test and an ultrasound — and pay the steep surgical fees. Each step felt like squeezing time and strength out of thin air. But somehow, through sheer tension, everything was resolved in the end.
Because I had to check in at the hospital at 5 a.m., and UCLA is far from home, with no friend able to drive me at three in the morning, I took a taxi there the night before. Under the thin mist of West Los Angeles, I walked alone for hours, then sat in a Denny’s drinking coffee, waiting for the hospital to open at 4:30.
I knew that before surgery, black coffee and coffee with milk aren’t the same thing. But I didn’t pay much attention; from 11 p.m. until 3 a.m., I kept drinking coffee with milk. I thought it was still a liquid, so it should be fine. It wasn’t.
At 4:30 I checked in. Everything was efficient — no unnecessary words. When I talked to the anesthesiologist, I told him honestly about the coffee. He looked concerned. In the end, they decided to delay the surgery from 7:30 to 8:30, to give my stomach six hours to digest the milk.
Then came the second problem — I started trembling. Not a small shiver, but a full-body shaking that made me feel pitiful even to myself. Mentally I was calm, speaking clearly, thinking straight, but my body refused to listen. The nurses didn’t know what to do. They took my blood pressure: it was low, around 50/80, with the systolic not even reaching 90. Normally mine is 110/70, sometimes 120/80. No one knew why.
After several attempts to sleep, I finally began to feel better.
As they wheeled me away, the staff explained that the next medication wouldn’t put me to sleep immediately — it would just relax me first, and then I’d be moved to another room for the final anesthesia, where I’d fall asleep in thirty seconds. I clearly remember them saying this, and before they even finished the sentence, the surgery was already over. The time between vanished completely. I don’t remember entering the operating room, or the oxygen mask, or the anesthesia.
When I woke up, it was already evening. The nurse gave me medication, an IV drip, and dinner. I ordered fettuccine Alfredo — surprisingly good. She asked me to rate the pain from 0 to 10. I said 0. I felt no pain at all.
I opened the front camera and looked at myself — the change was striking. I didn’t look like before. I had worried that just shaving the brow bone, lifting the brows, and reshaping the forehead wouldn’t be very noticeable, but it was. The difference was clear.
Earlier, the nurses had asked if I’d had gender reassignment surgery. I said no. They also asked about restroom preferences. Later I saw that they took care to be discreet and respectful. Throughout my stay they addressed me as “Ms.” or “Ma’am.” It was clear they’d been trained for this kind of sensitivity.
They brought me yogurt and pudding, and walked with me in the hallway. They spoke softly, moved carefully.
So I ate, rested, slept — until the next morning around 6:30. Dr. Lee’s team came to check on me. They said the doctor was very pleased with the results, and the swelling looked good. I could be discharged around nine. I called Ting-yu to come pick me up.
I ordered a large breakfast — a cheese omelet, scrambled eggs, fried tofu, canned peaches, and coffee. The cafeteria staff said I couldn’t order that much, but made an exception. I really could eat it all, especially the eggs.
A female nurse came to help me change clothes, which I did need, since I couldn’t bend my neck or look down. But I refused and changed slowly on my own, trying not to tilt my head. Putting on shoes was the hardest part.
Then the nurse took me to the pharmacy to pick up six kinds of medication I’d need to take daily. I waited for Ting-yu to arrive and take me home.
The discharge nurse was lovely — she asked what I wanted to drink. I said Diet Coke, and she actually brought it, along with extra sandwiches. An elderly man nearby wanted coffee; after confirming he was allowed, she walked a long way to get it for him. He was so happy, kept praising her.
After leaving the hospital, Ting-yu and I went for soy milk and rice rolls. Halfway through eating, I felt a bit of pain at the incision, so I moved to the front seat, reclined it, turned on the AC — soon I felt better again. My appetite was still strong. I was grateful to her.
