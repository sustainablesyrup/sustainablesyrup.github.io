    <pre>I had brought a lot of Coke, maybe 5 or 6 cans, and 2 liters of bottled water. Every time I passed a gas station, I would buy another big cup of fountain Coke—I can't remember if it was Diet—and chug it down quickly. But still weren't enough. The temperature that day was unbearably hot, around 33 degrees Celsius. Cloudless, that was early July, 2020 in Minnesota. By the second half of the ride, the total 5 liters[ 7 liters is approximately 1.85 US gallons or 236.7 US fluid ounces.] The beverages I brought were long gone. I had also finished who knows how many fountain Cokes, and somehow the gas stations along the road had started disappearing. All I could see were one hill after another, the blazing sun, and mailboxes that were distant from their owners along the highway.
    
    I laid down by the roadside against a tall, thick tree, not a palm tree.
    
    Unfortunately, every time I find myself beside a tree, my misfortune seems to form a certain dislocation with its beauty. 
    
    The last time I remember leaning against a tree was when I tried to visit a psychiatrist for my ADHD. Though my intention was limited to ADHD, psychiatrists seemed to diagnose me as either suicidal or afflicted by indescribable mental illness, rotating me through medications for depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. Perhaps because I scored at the highest level on every suicidal questionnaire. I remember taking Aripiprazole[ a common schizophrenia medication], and trying to go to school the following day. But shortly after stepping out of the car, my vision went dark. I rushed into the nearest bar and bought a fountain Coke, again, fountain Coke. 
    
    From a very young age, my mother taught me that Coke was the cure for everything. 
    
    She faced all sorts of discomfort by drinking Coke, especially her headaches, and I learned to do the same from her. On May 14, 2020, just two months before this ride, I had a strange dream titled Six Acts of Vision. Transcribed from a voice recording immediately after I woke up. Ever since knowing that opening my eyes causes me to lose my memory of dreams, I've avoided doing so：

<H3><strong>ACT III</strong></H3><i>
      I was in the study room of my childhood home, standing next to someone familiar, yet I didn't know who they were.
      A hole appeared in my left hand, a cigarette burn, deep and bottomless, emitting blue smoke that grew increasingly thick.
      I realized I was about to die.
      I might turn into nothing but ashes, leaving nothing behind.
      I told the person beside me that I was dying.
      Pus and food debris surged from the hole in my hand like a spring.
      My body felt as though it had been drained; I desperately needed food and water.
      I hastily swallowed peaches and cookies from the table.
      I called my parents and asked them to accompany me to the Nanjing Military Region General Hospital. 
      I asked my mom if she had brought water; she took out a bottle of cherry-flavored Coke.
      "Good," I said, "Coke is exactly what I need—Coke is the best water."
      I took out a baking foil, filled it with Ferrero chocolates, and rushed toward the hospital.
      Ultimately, I couldn't recall if I ever actually made it to the hospital.
      I still remember chatting with friends. Rui said my condition was something called "Wheat Shoal", and I wondered if perhaps "Wheat Shoal" was curable, meaning I might not have to die.
      I told that girl[ I was dating her in the first and second acts.], that I was about to die. She looked at me with an indifferent attitude. I tried explaining again that I really was dying, but she remained cheerful as ever. Strangely, I felt cheerful too.
      Yet, I still felt empty and incredibly hungry, as if everything was gone (after saying this, I paused for twenty seconds).
      I remember yelling at my parents to hurry up; they moved slowly. I told them, "Remember, soon I won't be able to speak or breathe. I can speak now because I'm using my last breath. Let's go quickly."
      Eventually, we left.
      Around 4 or 5 pm, we were in the city. The golden sunset beautifully illuminated the glass facades of buildings.
      We waited for a bus on the road. One bus arrived, but it was full, and someone nearby kept suggesting, "Let's wait for the next one, wait for the next one"
      I said, "Alright, let's wait for the next one."</i>

    Let's roll back to the day I went to work. As soon as I had the Coke in hand, I lost my sight and ability to move. I pressed myself against a nice tree and the ground; at that moment, my world consisted solely of the tree and the Coke. The tree became akin to doctors and nurses—it's easy for someone to develop affection for them during such moments. My hand fiercely felt the tree’s temperature, texture, peeling bark, and knots.
    
    Yet, the tree was not only a caretaker here, but also provided a certain social allowance. If I were to lie directly on the sidewalk—I have already begun imagining the sensation and relief from the ground’s temperature and pressure against my skin—it would neither conform to social norms nor respect the feelings of others. The thicker, healthier, and the more charged with multi-perspective observation demand the tree I lean against is, the more credible I appear at that moment. 
    
    Many slender palm trees, especially the Mexican fan palm, offer interactions that lack continuity, forcing one to almost religiously fling eyes or head upward to see their tops. The credibility and comfort they provide are hardly different from slightly thicker utility poles.
    
    Now let’s roll back again to the day of that ride. Stopping took a lot of willpower, because if I slowed down even a bit, the wind against my skin would lessen and the evaporative cooling from sweat would become insufficient, causing a burning heat.
    
    Feeling the heat burning inside and the energy gradually going away from my body, I tried to touch my face, but I couldn’t feel my skin at all—only a thick, thick layer of crystallized salt.
   
    I took out a little Ziploc bag of salt I had packed ahead of time and started eating it dry. Luckily, this time neither my mom nor Isak Dinesen was right, the cure was not coke nor salt water[ As Dinesen wrote, "The cure for anything is salt water: sweat, tears, or the sea."], but dry, crystallized salt.
