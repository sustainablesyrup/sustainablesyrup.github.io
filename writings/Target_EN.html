     <pre>The search for coffee in St. Louis did not go smoothly. I stopped by a few gas stations, but the stores were all closed. I realized that this stop-and-go pattern at gas stations was especially draining—it consumed energy, brought frustration, and made me feel exhausted. Eventually, I found a 7-Eleven. Parked in front, I drank the drip coffee greedily, smoked a cigarette, and tried to comprehend my body in the cold wind.

    Unlike the “mid- to short-distance” 500- or 1100-mile drives I usually do, where I might indulge myself in physical comfort, I had told myself from the moment I left Bloomington that this time, I needed to remain calm, stay steady—or at least try to. When I entered Oklahoma’s fog-blanketed toll road at dawn, I had already been awake for over 20 hours. And ahead of me lay another 25 hours of driving. I didn’t even dare to listen to music. Instead, I spent that time trying to stabilize my heart rate and suppress the faint but persistent sensation of inner heat—almost like inflammation—that long or intense driving easily provokes. Of course, many times these attempts failed, and I ended up howling repeatedly in the musicless driving cabin.

    Back in Southern California, whether it was ordinary commuting or slightly more intense driving activities, I had already become used to this inflammation-like bodily heat, and I was pretty clear on how to counter it. My method was simply to go to a grocery store but not buy anything, just walk around the aisles, immerse myself in all the neatly arranged products, and conduct some mental exercises on the philosophical temperament of the grocery store. After doing this for a while, I discovered that Target was my best place to relax.

    If driving is a way for me to immerse myself in a Deleuzian, Guattarian, or J.G. Ballardian Body Without Organs[ See: Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia, trans. Brian Massumi (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1987), pp. 149–166.], or even a David Lynch Twin Peaks-like dark-energy environment, then walking into a chain grocery store and soaking myself inside to cool down is like a ritual of reterritorialization or a practice of re-anchoring—returning from a BwO to a “not-quite-body,” not quite the old body, but never quite the new one either. At that moment, what I need to extinguish the heat in my body isn’t any strong statement, useful information, or effective action, but the most generic, most mundane, and medium-level curated and industrially-produced sense of simulacral familiarity in my view.

    Non-chain, culturally specific, community-based, or ethnically characterized local grocery stores clearly wouldn’t work—I don’t have the brainpower to process that much new information. 

    I found that even Walmart, Costco, Whole Foods, and Erewhon couldn’t give me what I needed. 

    Walmart, as a mode of action, is too effective—it always offers the cheapest products, usually its own brand. Their  product selection feels more on a conservative side. For example, they sell hunting equipment and lots of cross necklaces. Actually,  my first cross necklace was bought at Walmart after the employee spent half an hour trying to unlock its container. Their visual layout  doesn’t pursue any form of aesthetic, nor does it feel curated. It is the logic of maximal liberty under weak state order. 

    Costco, needless to mention, feels like some kind of working middle class trap. Costco literally tries to teach you how to buy groceries.

    Meanwhile, Whole Foods, Erewhon, and Gelson’s lie on the other extreme, where their statements or sense of curation are too strong, full of exquisite rhetoric about biohacking and sustainability.

    Some of the products at Whole Foods and Gelson’s, and the majority of products at Erewhon, I believe even go beyond the actions around nature and organic. Many of them are already engaging in a more complex, alchemical or magical kind of problem-solving logic—for instance, a $20 enzyme/anti-inflammatory/antioxidant drink or smoothie actually conveys a message that encourages individual salvation, rejecting already existing or easily verifiable systems of knowledge or institutions, rejecting doctors. Each product is accompanied by a set of hidden, poetic, and shamanistic keywords.

    This resembles the pharmacopornographic[ Preciado, Paul B. Testo Junkie: Sex, Drugs, and Biopolitics in the Pharmacopornographic Era. The Feminist Press, 2008.

    The term pharmacopornographic describes the intersection of pharmaceuticals, sexuality, and institutional power, highlighting how bodies are regulated and commodified through chemical and economic means. ] form of institutional economic violence described by Preciado, infiltrating into the neoliberal space of the grocery store as a medium, where it becomes a biohacking stripped of agency.

    I might enjoy these products and the atmospheres of those spaces on normal days, but absolutely not when I’ve already de-territorialized my body through driving or when I’ve turned into an overheated, inflamed Body Without Organs. 

    What I need then are simple, weak, generic, simulacral things—and Target, just like its name, becomes my destination in that state. The bright red logo and carts that are neither ugly nor attractive, the Starbucks to the right of the entrance, the fashion and home sections that are lightly designed and polished but still cheap, the totally unappealing meat and fruit that give you the sense no one would come to Target just for them, that they’re only bought incidentally, and those rows and rows of basic, unremarkable shelves—all of it makes me feel relaxed and safe in that moment. I don’t need to become anything, and I don’t need to lose anything. So many of humanity’s overly obvious desires, chaos, and darkness are hidden inside Target. And so, countless times, after falling into a kind of heatstroke-like state from driving, I’ve fled into a Target, letting myself disappear within.
