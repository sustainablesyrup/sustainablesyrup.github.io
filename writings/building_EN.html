    <pre>       The peculiarity of large residential buildings lies in their ability to accommodate a massive number of people—and their personal belongings—within a confined space for extended periods of time. Each object carries a traceable individual history. By contrast, spaces like stadiums, shopping malls, and office towers are essentially transient; they dissolve as soon as the day’s activities end.
        
        Hotels and airports, though also capable of housing many people in limited space, belong in many senses to a “no-man’s-land.” They are transitional zones—you know you are about to arrive, and you know you will soon depart. The objects there are uniform, devoid of vitality, belonging to everyone and to no one. In such spaces, every detail subtly signals a state of “in-betweenness”—a condition of temporary dwelling. I often experience peculiar physiological reactions in these ownerless realms—sometimes excitement, sometimes unease.
        
        I have heard many intriguing explanations for this feeling. Some suggest that the spatial cues of hotels and airports constantly remind the body that departure is imminent, producing a strange form of physiological certainty.
        
        Marc Augé’s articulation in Non-Places: Introduction to an Anthropology of Supermodernity offers a compelling perspective “The hypothesis advanced here is that supermodernity produces non-places. A world where people are born in the clinic and die in hospital, where transit points and temporary abodes are proliferating under luxurious or inhuman conditions; where a dense network of means of transport which are also inhabited spaces is developing; where the habitue of supermarkets, slot machines and credit cards communicates wordlessly through gestures, with an abstract, unmediated commerce;” [ Augé, Marc. Non-Places: Introduction to an Anthropology of Supermodernity. Translated by John Howe, Verso, 1995, pp. 78.] 
        
        In 2019-2020, the winter right before the pandemic, I ended up living in a building in Jinan called Chengji Center by chance due to financial constraints. It was an unforgettable building, with no fewer than sixteen entrances, each equipped with two elevators—though one of them was often out of service. The scene inside was even stranger; people smoked openly in the elevators, something that felt highly incongruous in the heart of a second-tier Chinese city in 2020. The damaged walls were plastered with advertisements for sex work. The interior of the building was even more surreal; I had rarely seen a single building with direct elevators, escalators, and glass observation elevators all coexisting. What made it even stranger was that, despite these features, the building’s primary function had shifted from office space to residential use. Each floor was crowded with parked electric scooters, and the stairwells were filled with piles of garbage that cascaded down from the upper floors to the lower levels, turning the space into a literal garbage dump. 
        
        This building was truly captivating. On one hand, it was not an isolated place—just a ten to twenty-minute walk from Jinan’s busiest downtown area and an excellent school district. Downstairs, you could even buy bagels—a near non-existent and unfamiliar American food in China in 2020, and honestly, it still is today. To this day, I still don’t understand why bagels were sold downstairs. On the other hand, everything about this place seemed detached from reality; the law seemed almost non-existent here, otherwise it wouldn’t have become an ideal place for sex workers and drug users for such a long time. Law enforcement was almost powerless against the more than 5,000 residents unless drastic measures were taken. Property management was virtually absent—leaks, power outages, fires, and airborne trash were all common occurrences. 
        
        The unfinished graffiti-covered tall building in downtown Los Angeles was in a similar position, which was originally an EB-5 investment immigration project initiated by Chinese investors. After securing their green cards or for various other reasons, the investors withdrew from the project, leaving it unfinished and turning it into a giant sponge for graffiti in downtown LA. The situation with this building in Jinan is quite similar, over 90% of those who invested in the building ended up in prison for corruption. Strangely enough, an identical high-rise with the same name and investors was also built in another city, Tianjin, which has a lower population density and a vastly different social environment. Yet, it resulted in the same building condition and social consequence. This almost makes me believe that such buildings and their inevitable failures are not mere coincidences, but rather the result of some predetermined energy force at play.
 	      
        It was not transient and not devoid of memory or identity. On the contrary, it accumulated residue—both physical and social—with almost violent density. In some sense, this building was a hyper-place: relational to a scam, saturated with failure, decay. 
        
        Supermodernity does not simply erase place into non-place. In certain contexts—particularly in post-socialist China—it produces too much place. The example of Chengji Center was not the only case, there were so many more residential real estate projects that overestimated the population and housing needs, built to absurdly large scale. resulted in failures and low quality of lives, and eventually became dystopian landmarks that almost symbolize loss, charged with logistical impossibilities, and residual social structures that they become unmanageable, even self-destructive. The failures of such buildings are not exceptions to supermodernity, but extensions of it—extensions that fall outside of Augé’s original theoretical horizon, and demand a new grammar.
        
        Fredric Jameson once described postmodern architecture as a closed, labyrinthine structure— cut off from historical continuity or exterior referents.[ Jameson, Fredric. Postmodernism, or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism. Duke University Press, 1991, pp. 38–39.] What I encountered in buildings like Chengji Center was the crisis of an overgrown high entropy closed system—too massive to manage, too sealed to adapt.
        
        In theories of arcology or ecological architecture, and even evolutionary biology, it is often assumed that the larger a structure or a population, the more resilient it becomes—against disease, entropy, or collapse[ Soleri, Paolo. Arcology: The City in the Image of Man. MIT Press, 1973, pp. 16–19.]. That’s a basic principle of adaptive infrastructure. But unfortunately these giant buildings or apartment complexes in contemporary China—like Chengji Center in Jinan and Tianjin, Huaguoshan in Guiyang and all their kins—are not ecological architectures and are not resilient systems. 
        
        People in China like to call those neighborhoods, if they are neighborhoods, “hive”, but even that’s a misnomer. There is no real hive logic here—only thousands of isolated compartments, separated by drywall and malfunctioning elevators, minimal sunlight, unmanaged logistics, failing waste systems, and sometimes a daily enactment of the second law of thermodynamics in the stairwells of Chengji Center.
        
        It’s isolation walls off rhythms, echoes, resonance. The building is giant yet there is no surplus space for collective improvisation. And without echo, there is no ritual.
        
        When I was a child, when I lived in what could be called a “courtyard compound,” for university faculty. Every evening, I would play piano in the living room, accompanied by a chorus of sounds drifting from other apartments—all kinds of strings, wind and keyboard instruments. That was the communal rhythm of that compound, a shared temporal ritual. Looking back as an adult, it feels almost unbelievable—how could something like that have existed?
        
        People need rituals. Schools have them; hospitals have them. Even airports and hotels—though transitory—create rhythmic forms of collective experience: departure, arrival, check-in, security.
        
        A ritual, at its core, is an act that anchors meaning in another person’s lived time.
        
        Take learning, for instance. If all we needed were knowledge, we could simply search online, watch videos, read forums. Why, then, do we still go to class? Because we need the ritual of class.
        
        We need others—classmates, teachers, administrators—to offer up pieces of their lives, so that through their sacrifice, we might feel the weight of our own.
        
        Residential buildings like Chengji Center bear no such sacrificial or ritual consensus. Everyone is sacrificing something—but in silence, in chaos, and with great difficulties on-recognition of others. As Maurice Bloch writes in Prey into Hunter, sacrifice and rituals bind individuals to the group through a shared offering. This process, however, is contingent upon consensus. If the group fails to absorb and refrae the individual’s sacrifice, if the offering is not seen, not heard, not metabolized—then sacrifice ceases to be a medium of meaning. Then It becomes violence, entropy, or solitude[ Maurice Bloch, Prey into Hunter: The Politics of Religious Experience, Cambridge University Press, 1992, pp. 3–5.]. 
        
        Like ancient rituals where ox blood soaked the land to invoke fertility, people today soak buildings with their energy, time, and bodily wear. But the building, unlike land, offers no fertility—only decay. It is not that people refuse to sacrifice—but that the space itself is unable to recognize or metabolize their sacrifice.
